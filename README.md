### Overview

This is a port of https://tiny.ink using [Dedot](https://dedot.dev) to show-case how dapps can interact with ink! smart contracts with type-safe APIs from Dedot.

The dapp is live at: https://link.dedot.dev.

The contract is deployed on [POP Network](https://popnetwork.xyz/) ([address](https://github.com/dedotdev/link/blob/e349ee062040cdcbb7a04f1172fb92ffae9cc0f1/contracts/deployments/link/pop-network.ts))

### Development

1. Generate Types & APIs for the link contract using dedot cli

```shell
pnpm typink

# OR
dedot typink -m ./contracts/deployments/link/link.json -o ./contracts/deployments/types
```

2. Start development application

```shell
pnpm dev
```

3. Deploy the contract. Make sure to have a local [subtrate-contract-node](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node) running on you local at https://127.0.0.1:9944

```sh
# In `contracts` folder
pnpm run script deploy
```
